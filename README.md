# OSIS-Louvain Documentation

OSIS-Louvain Documentation is a repository focused on the documentation of the project OSIS-Louvain. It contains business and technical artefacts related to the business. It is separated from the repository osis-louvain because the development process put in place requires that tickets to modify the documentation should be managed separatedly from the tickets to modify the application.
