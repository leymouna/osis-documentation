= OSIS-Louvain Documentation

OSIS-Louvain Documentation is a repository focused on the documentation of the 
project https://github.com/uclouvain/osis[OSIS]. It contains business and 
technical artefacts related to the business. It is separated from the 
repository https://github.com/uclouvain/osis[osis] because the development 
process in place requires that tickets to modify the documentation should be 
managed separatedly from the tickets to modify the application.
