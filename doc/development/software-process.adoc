== Introduction

This document describes the development process of the application OSIS-Louvain.

OSIS stands for Open Student Information System. It's an application designed to manage the core business of higher education institutions, such as universities, faculties, institutes and professional schools. The core business involves the administration of students, teachers, courses, programs and so on.

This application is designed as a module of Odoo, a modular ERP framework written in Python. It can be extended to accommodate your specific needs, which is the case of OSIS-Louvain.

OSIS is an open source software sponsored by Université catholique de Louvain.

=== Communication

For being open source, the communication strategy changes from the traditional internal communication to a global and transparent one. People should consider not only the participation of the internal team, but also developers and users all around the world. Therefore, to allow global and transparent communication, we have to comply with the following rules:

 1. Communication directed to the local community can be done in English or in the native language.
 2. Communication directed to the global community should be done in English only.
 3. The code should be written in English only.
 4. The user interface is multilingual but it will initially support English and French. The support for additional languages depends on the adoption of the software and the contributions from the community.
 5. Since there is not private source, all the communication is done using public channels such as mailing lists, chats, wikis and others.
 6. To be taken into account, a communication should be registered textually and preserved historically. Direct email communication between two or a subset of the team is not considered valid because all stakeholders should be equally informed.

To support the communication rules, we have created the following channels:

The team that maintains the context-free module communicates through the chat
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS in English only.

The team that discusses the context-specific module communicates through the chat
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS-Louvain in English or in French, the local native language.

The development community communicates through the group
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-dev in English only.

The users community communicates through the group
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-user in English or in French.

News about the project can be found at: http://uclouvain.github.io/OSIS/.

Development statistics about the project can be found at

Organizations that support the development of OSIS through a context-specific module can follow their own internal rules of communication.

=== Processes

Our software methodology is composed of 4 processes: *Analysis*, *Development*, *Test*, and *Support*. These processes run in two parallel iterations and one on-demand execution.

image::images/overview.png[Overview]

The iteration of the analysis lasts for 2 weeks. This iteration is independent from the development, so analysts do not have to wait for the outcome of the development to advance with their analysis. It also means that we expect a release coming out from each iteration, just like application releases. Therefore, the analysis should be planned, executed, integrated, tested and released, as traditionally done with code.

Development and test are in the same iteration because everything that is developed should be tested before going into production. The tests should be done by someone else not directly involved on the development of the ongoing version. This iteration also lasts from 2 weeks and occurs in the same time frame of the analysis. The output of the analysis serves as input for the development and test. However, the output is accumulated in a backlog before being allocated in the upcoming development iterations.

The support is an on-demand process, executed only when an issue in production is reported. Every issue starts an independent instance of the process. There is no fixed duration of the execution, but it has higher priority than other processes and the minimal waiting time is 12 working hours.

More details about each one of these processes are described in the following sections.

=== Roles

User:: All those who use the application or lead other users. They can also be representatives of a larger group of users. They should transmit to analysts the maximum amount of information possible about the need they have and be available for questions and meetings as demanded by analysts once a RFC is created, in order to minimize the impact on the schedule. Users can only contact analysts. If they contact anybody else in the team, they risk to have their demand ignored.
s
Analyst:: Responsible for documenting how the business works and translating the documentation into application functionalities. They produce the business process models and the user manual. The analysts are the only ones authorized to contact the users. If anybody else contact the user directly they risk to break the chain of traceability.

Technical Leader:: Responsible for the leadership of the development team. It's the leader who create the tickets based on the RFCs, plan the releases and distribute the work among developers. The leader should also monitor the project to detect and fix non-conformities, identify deficiencies that impact the team's productivity and act to overcome those deficiencies. The technical leader can only talk to a user if followed by an analyst.

Developer:: Responsible for developing the application according to the instructions in the user manual. They have the technical knowledge to transform business needs into application features, but they do not necessarily have business knowledge because they should always rely on the user manual. It makes possible that any developer is capable of developing any part of the application even if s/he know nothing about it.

Tester:: Responsible for making sure the application behaves exactly as foreseen in the user manual. They have the technical knowledge to create test scripts to automate tests, checking whether everything works fine after every introduced change.

Supporter:: Responsible for the support for users, explaining them how to use the application if the user manual is not sufficiently clear. In the case the application  is not behaving as expected, the supporter is responsible for reproducing the problem and create a high priority issue to be addressed by developers.

== Analysis

image::images/analysis.png[Analyse]

=== Report a business need

The user can request new features or modifications in the application. It can be done in many different ways because it is not formalized. Users and analysts are free to decide how they will communicate.

=== Verify the impact on business processes

Requests for changes should be aligned with what already exists in terms of processes. They should contribute to improve existing processes or add new processes connected to existing ones. Changes that are not aligned with existing processes or propose isolated processes must be rejected until the application evolves to a point that those changes make sense. In summary, changes should be contextualized.

=== Create request for change

Ia a context is found for the change then a ticket is created to track the changes. This ticket is also called RFC (Request For Change) and is allocated to an analyst who will proceed with the analysis.

RFCs are managed in the repository https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-louvain-documentation.

A RFC must contain:

- A *title* that summarizes in one sentence the content of the change;
- A detailed *description* of the change;
- The *analyst* responsible for the analysis of the change;
- The *user* who requested the change;
- The *full path to the process element* that is impacted by the change.

=== Modify the impacted business processes

A RFC allows the analyst to modify artifacts, such as the business process model.

Modifications in the processes do not necessarily imply on modifications in the application. Some activities are automated in the application and others are manual. Therefore, a change may modify the process and the application, only the process or only the application. If the processes don't change, then this activity is irrelevant.

=== Create a new business process

The criteria to create a new process are extensive and sometimes subjective. In general, if the business need does not fit in an existing process or it requires substantial amount of work then it is a potential candidate for a new process. In any case, it is not a simple decision and it needs to be extensively discussed with users.

=== Review business process

The user should review the process and approve it in order to move forward. Otherwise, analysts and users keep adjusting the process until it is in condition to be approved.

=== Describe the execution of the process

During this activity, analysts are actually writing the user manual.

For the purpose of traceability, every new section or modification in an existing section should have a dedicated branch.

=== Review the execution of the process
=== Verify technical feasibility

== Development

image::images/development.png[Development]

=== Create work breakdown structure
=== Create requests for change
=== Demand developers estimations
=== Estimate requests

These are the types of effort:

- *Unknown*: the team does not have the necessary knowledge to address the issue. Therefore, an investigation should be carried out and no extimation can be done.
- *Complex*: the team has the necessary knowledge to address the issue but cannot estimate when the work will be finished.
- *Heavy*: the team has the necessary knowledge to address the issue and estimate the work but the issue cannot be solved in less than 5 working days.
- *Regular*: the team has the neccessary knowledge to address the issue and estimate the work but the issue cannot be solved in less than 2 days.
- *Easy*: the team has the necessary knowledge to address the issue, estimate the work and finish it in less than 2 days.
- *Flash*: the issue can be solved in a couple of hours.

=== Distribute requests in upcoming iterations
=== Review project schedule
=== Inform user
=== Start upcoming iteration
=== Develop requests for change

The last person allocated in a ticket is the only one authorized to close that ticket.

=== Create automated tests for change
=== Release QA version

== Test
